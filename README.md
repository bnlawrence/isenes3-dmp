Data Management Plan for the IS-ENES3 project

This repository holds the formal data management plan for the [IS-ENES3](is.enes.org) project. 

The 1.0 version of the DMP will be project deliverable D1.1, and it will be regularly updated throughout the project.

The DMP is written in markdown, so it should be straightfoward not only to difference sequential versions of the DMP but also any 
two versions.

The published version is generated using pandoc on a mac, using the following command:
   
   ```pandoc -o isenes3-dmp-vXX.docx --reference-doc isenes3.docx IS-ENES3-Data-Management-Plan.md```

where XX is adjusted as appropriate, and then Word is used to save as pdf.
